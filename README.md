🧠 Converso – AI-Powered Learning SaaS Platform

Converso is a full-featured AI learning companion — a real-time, voice-driven education platform built as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) app.
It allows users to interact with custom AI tutors, learn at their own pace, and even pay for premium learning plans via Stripe.

🌟 Features

🎙️ Voice-Driven Learning – Real-time conversational AI lessons using advanced voice APIs.

🧑‍💻 Authentication & Profiles – Secure login/signup via Clerk with profile management.

💳 Subscriptions & Payments – Tier-based plans (Free, Pro, Enterprise) integrated with Stripe Billing.

📚 Dynamic Courses – Personalized, interactive AI lessons tailored to the user’s goals.

🔍 Smart Search – Quickly find lessons and topics.

🕒 Session History & Bookmarks – Save and revisit past learning sessions.

⚙️ Admin & Analytics Ready – Built to scale with Supabase and Sentry.

💬 Responsive Modern UI – Designed with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI for a polished SaaS look.

🧾 Error Tracking – Sentry integration for real-time monitoring and smooth production experience.
